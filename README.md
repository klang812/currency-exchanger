# Currency Exchange

#### Week 5 API calls and Asynchrony

#### By _**Kerry Lang**_

## Technologies Used

* _CSS, html5, JavaScript_
* _API, webpack, npm_
* _Bootstrap, jQuery_
* _see package.JSON for thorough list of dependencies_

## Description
_This project was intended to test my knowledge using API calls and asynchonous functions.  The website converts the US dollar to a selection of international monetary values.  I was able to make a successful API call and returned errors from both the user and if the currency was not available for conversion._

## How to Get Your Own API key
* destination will be unique to project needs
* make sure .env is listed in .gitignore (one does NOT want to share API key/s accidentally)
* create a .env file at the root directory
* get your own unique key from `https://app.exchangerate-api.com/dashboard#`
* store the key _without quotes_ in .env preceded by `API_KEY = `
